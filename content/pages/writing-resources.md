{{% resource_link "856654de-eaff-4f8d-f018-125366be5ac1" "Acknowledging sources (PDF)" %}}   
This one-page handout describes when and how to acknowledge/cite sources. It was written for term papers, but much of the advice applies to shorter writing as well.

{{% resource_link "dada4750-1c83-239e-8174-1e45629c2fd0" "Common comments on 18.310 writing (PDF)" %}}   
This is a list of common comments compiled from when the course was taught during Spring 2012. It is organized into categories such as how to structure a paper, acknowledge contributors, incorporate equations, and make revisions. These guidelines may be helpful for writing well, but they are not sufficient. Remain focused on your goal: to write clearly and convincingly for the assigned context.
